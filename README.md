# Deep Learning Model for Alzheimer's Diagnosis - NeuroNet

## Introduction

This project is a deep learning model that can diagnose Alzheimer's Disease through MRI data. Moreover, it can even detect Alzheimer's early, in the form of early mild cognitive impairment and late mild cognitive impairment. While this model isn't meant to be a definitive test to diagnose Alzheimer's, it can serve as an initial diagnostic tool. 

The model is a convolutional neural network that analyzes 3D MRI images. A much more thorough explanation of the technical specifications, including image preprocessing and the model training is in the next few sections.

This project was inspired by the wonderful work conducted by Oscar Darias Plasencia that can be seen [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/alzheimer-diagnosis-with-deep-learning-a-survey-265406fa542a).
